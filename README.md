# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on various factors like age, gender, ticket class, fare, etc. The dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, and the goal is to classify them as "survived" or "did not survive."
